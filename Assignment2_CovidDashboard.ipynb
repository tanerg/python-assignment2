    "In this assignment you will design and develop a (live) dashboard to show Covid-19 information and trends in the Netherlands on an annual basis. These trends concern the total number of reported cases, the number of hospital admissions, and the number of deaths. The Dashboard shows these trends at two levels: the entire country and the level of the province. Figures 1-4 give examples of these trends.\n",

    "To create this dashboard, you can use the datasets made available by the data.overheid.nl website. You can find the updated datasets here:\n",
    "(Please note: The Netherlands has reached an endemic phase for the SARS-CoV-2 virus (coronavirus) and the GGD test lanes have been closed as of March 17, 2023. As a result, the data will no longer be updated as of April 1, 2023.)\n",

    "The requirements are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    " <li>Perform basic functionality as depicted in Figure 1-4.</li>\n",
    " <li>Runtime of the program: Note that the data from the above datasets covers the beginning of the pandemic from 2020 to the present. Since the resulting files are large to be processed by Jupyter Notebook, it may be necessary to split the data by year to have a separate file for each year. The required prior knowledge of the chosen course must be met.</li> \n",
    " <li>Interactivity: The dashboard provided should be interactive and changing the input (e.g. changing the year or checking/unchecking checkboxes) should have an immediate effect on the results.</li> \n",
    " <li>Extend the dashboard with more insightful features: This is an open and creative part of the assignment. You are expected to add additional features to the dashboard to gain a more insightful view of the data.</li> \n",
    " <li>You are required to deliver an executable Jupyter notebook document to execute and display the dashboard.</li> \n",
    "\n",
    " <li>Submitting a short report (max. 2 pages PDF) to explain the programme and its structure, assumptions, implementation, etc.</li> \n",
